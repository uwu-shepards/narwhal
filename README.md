Censorship is the enemy

## Get started

```
ignite chain serve
```

`serve` command installs dependencies, builds, initializes, and starts your blockchain in development.

### Configure

Your blockchain in development can be configured with `config.yml`. To learn more, see the [Ignite CLI docs](https://docs.ignite.com).

### Web Frontend

Additionally, Ignite CLI offers both Vue and React options for frontend scaffolding:

For a Vue frontend, use: `ignite scaffold vue`
For a React frontend, use: `ignite scaffold react`
These commands can be run within your scaffolded blockchain project.

For more information see the [monorepo for Ignite front-end development](https://github.com/ignite/web).

## Release

To release a new version of your blockchain, create and push a new tag with `v` prefix. A new draft release with the configured targets will be created.

```
git tag v0.1
git push origin v0.1
```

After a draft release is created, make your final changes from the release page and publish it.

### Install

To install the latest version of your blockchain node's binary, execute the following command on your machine:

```
curl https://get.ignite.com/uwu-shepards/narwhal! | sudo bash
```
